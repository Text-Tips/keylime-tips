# A list of versions to enable can be provided (e.g. "2.1, 2.2")

# - "default": Enables all supported API versions

# If you set this to "generate", Keylime will create a random UUID.
# If you set this to "hash_ek", Keylime will set the UUID to the result

# If you set this to "environment", Keylime will use the value of the
# environment variable "KEYLIME_AGENT_UUID" as UUID.
# If you set this to "dmidecode", Keylime will use the UUID from
# 'dmidecode -s system-uuid'.
# If you set this to "hostname", Keylime will use the full qualified domain
# name of current host as the agent id.
